## Technology Used
-Javascript

-Mongoose

-Express

-Dotenv

-Insomnia(Post Man works as well with this application)

## Usage
-Clone the repo https://github.com/gmumpower/socialNetworkApi-min

-If you dont have it already, download MongoDB and set it up for a server

-Install dependencies in the commandline including
  -mongoose
  -dontenv
  -express
  
-npm i into the commandline to make sure you have the correct depends

-npm start into the commandline and once it had started, it will start on your localhost:3001(or otherwise changed port)

-Then use Insomnia or Postman application to register your requests and enjoy!
